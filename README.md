# Sentiment-Analysis-Twitter-

This project performs sentiment analysis on Twitter data using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on the text content.

# Introduction
This project involves analyzing tweets to determine the sentiment expressed in each tweet. The sentiment analysis is crucial for understanding public opinion, monitoring brand reputation, and more. We use natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to classify the sentiment of tweets.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of tweets collected from Twitter, labeled with their corresponding sentiment. The dataset can be sourced from various Twitter datasets available online, or you can use the Twitter API to collect your data.

# Usage
To use the notebook:

1. Open the Sentiment Analysis Twitter.ipynb file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Ensure that all dependencies are installed by running the cells in the notebook.
3. Load the dataset and preprocess the data.
4. Train the machine learning model on the training data.
5. Test the model on the test data and evaluate its performance.
6. Run the model on new tweets to predict their sentiment.
